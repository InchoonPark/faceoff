FaceOff is a cross platform Android and iOS app created using React Native where friends can play realtime matches against each other. The objective of the game is for users match their facial expressions on the screen to the emoji present on the screen to get points and have more points than their opponent. It utilizes Twilio's WebRTC libraries to implement videochat and Microsoft Cognitive Services to identify facial emotions. This repository houses the React Native code as well as the server code which is available in the server folder. It is available to download at (https://faceoff.lol)!
